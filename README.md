## Let's do the session in english!

## Road map
1. Introduction: What are Beacons
    1. no classic presentation, let the students try the beacons live (Tobias will bring 4-5 beacons with him. they have different form factors...) with their smart phones
    2. provide a QR code with a link to a beaon finder app (for android and iOS)
    3. technical infomartion via flip chart ( see [YouTube video - 10 Things you need to know about Beacons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L44m7otNI7o) )

2. Use cases
    1. short group work (brain storming) for the students by row. 
    2. Question: What use cases can you imagine after you have seen what a beacon is? (5-10 Minutes)
    3. Gather results on a flipchart, add our (common) solutions, give further feedback/comments to the suggested solutions

3. Hands on (node.js /socket.io)
    1. node.js and socket.io was used by tobias for a real world beacon project. First he'll tell the students about it.
    2. He will bring along a raspberry pi and will work out a interactive learning session to give the students an idea about socket.io

4. What did we learn / Take home messages ( via [Menti](https://www.menti.com/) )
    1. max. 5 questions as this is the free menti account limit

5. provide handout (maybe a small gap text?)
