## Let's do the session in english!

## Road map

### Introduction: What are Beacons

* no classic presentation, let the students try the beacons live (Tobias will bring 4-5 beacons with him. they have different form factors...) with their smart phones

* provide a QR code with a link to a beaon finder app (for android and iOS)

* technical infomartion via flip chart ( see [YouTube video - 10 Things you need to know about Beacons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L44m7otNI7o) )

### Use cases

* short group work (brain storming) for the students by row. 

* Question: What use cases can you imagine after you have seen what a beacon is? (5-10 Minutes)

* Gather results on a flipchart, add our (common) solutions, give further feedback/comments to the suggested solutions

### Hands on (node.js /socket.io)

* node.js and socket.io was used by tobias for a real world beacon project. First he'll tell the students about it.

* He will bring along a raspberry pi and will work out a interactive learning session to give the students an idea about socket.io

### What did we learn / Take home messages ( via [Menti](https://www.menti.com/) )

* max. 5 questions as this is the free menti account limit

### provide handout

* differences RFID -> BLE -> GPS

* maybe a small gap text?)
